// This stl is used to calculate the prefix sum of vector
// It does not return anything works on the vector whose iterators are provided

// if you want to store the prefix of array a into array b
partial_sum(a, a + 5, b);
// other wise if you want to do that in same thing can try out following syntax
partial_sum(array.begin(),array.end(),array.begin());

// as there is custome sort function in cast of sort stl you can add custom funciton here also
